# Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Extension for Magento

'Mobile web is slow, clunky and [a] frustrating experience' - [AMP Home Page](https://www.ampproject.org/) 

The Magento 1.x shopping cart CMS is one of the slowest systems out there. The only thing store owners can do to make it faster is using Cache and a CDN. Now, thanks to this extension, Magento store owners can integrate Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) into their Magento store. It's very easy and explained on this page: [Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) for Magento](http://codingbasics.net/accelerated-mobile-pages-magento/)
## Why Read Only?
Magento 1.x needs JavaScript to do almost anything on the platform. ~~Because I wanted to get this out fast~~ For that reason when creating this package I decided to put together a barebones example of AMP's for Magento.

## More information on AMP⚡
[AMP HTML](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/about-amp.html) is a way to build web pages for static content that render with reliable, fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what many perceive as painfully slow page load times – especially when reading content on the mobile web.

If you are creating AMP pages, check out the docs on [ampproject.org](https://www.ampproject.org/).

## Do not suffer a loss in traffic
Google is moving to promote sites that use AMP to the top of the search rankings in a carousel feature. Some believe it already does. Don't leave your customers behind when you could make a stupidly simple change. Most importantly the big guys wont have this yet. Win win. You get more mobile customers and have a bigger revenue in turn.

## Installation
**1. TO DO**
